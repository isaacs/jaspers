JASPERS

Like PHP, but Javascript.

Using Google's v8 javascript parsing engine.


INSTALLATION

Run "make clean && make" in the project directory. This will compile all the binaries into the bin folder.

You must have g++, scons, svn, and python installed in order to build the v8 library.

"You must be the change you want to see in the world."
